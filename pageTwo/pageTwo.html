    <h1> Day One </h1>
    <p> Join us at our stamp collecting event, where you'll be walking around to discover where each animal are located.
        Once you've located the animals, there wil be a station for you to stamp your sheet. Not only will you be able to collect
        stamps at each station, you're also able to play and pet the animals while you're there. Collecting stamps will give you
        a chance to enter an application to adopt and to be considered to be our furry friends' forever home. There will also be
        food stands and small businesses selling all types things, which are great for friends, family, and partners bonding!
