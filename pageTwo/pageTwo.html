<div class="dayOne">
    <h1> Day One </h1>
    <p> Join us at our stamp collecting event, where you'll be walking around to discover where each animal are located.
        Once you've located the animals, there wil be a station for you to stamp your sheet. Not only will you be able to collect
        stamps at each station, you're also able to play and pet the animals while you're there. Collecting stamps will give you
        a chance to enter an application to adopt and to be considered to be our furry friends' forever home. All you have to do
        is send in an application through a QR code to a google link we provide, which allows our staff to review if each applicant is
        suited to care for a pet. There will also be food stands and small businesses selling all types things, which are great 
        for friends, family, and partners bonding!

        active with cute furry friends. There will be different time sessions for people to join. Just sign up on the list
        with different time slots and arrive 5 minutes before. Along with animal yoga, there will still be food vendors, small
        businesses, and themed mini games to take advantage of! This will also be the final day to send in your application for 
        adoption. Those who sent in their application on the first or second day would be able to see if you've been approved or 
        not to adopt. If approved, you'll be able to pick your forever pet, and go through a bit of training with one of our 
        ASPCA staff to make sure your pet gets the proper care. After the training,there will be a small starter kit of essentials 
        for you to take home for your new furry friend. As for those who sent in their applications on day three, you'll get approval 
        within 1-2 business days and recieve the same training and starter kit at our meet up location. Come have fun with us on the
