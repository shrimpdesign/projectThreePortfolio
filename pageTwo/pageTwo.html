        <h1> 12|08 Day One: Stamp Collection </h1>
        <!-- <p> Join us at our stamp collecting event, where you'll be walking around to discover where each animal are located.
        Once you've located the animals, there wil be a station for you to stamp your sheet. Not only will you be able to collect
        stamps at each station, you're also able to play and pet the animals while you're there. Collecting stamps will give you
        a chance to enter an application to adopt and to be considered to be our furry friends' forever home. All you have to do
        is send in an application through a QR code to a google link we provide, which allows our staff to review if each applicant is
        suited to care for a pet. There will also be food stands and small businesses selling all types things, which are great 
        for friends, family, and partners bonding!
